#Double Gate MOSFET Based 1T DRAM Cell

This project presents the TCAD design and transient analysis of a 1T DRAM cell implemented using a double-gate MOSFET, simulated in Silvaco ATLAS. The memory operation relies on charge storage in the floating body region, eliminating the need for an explicit capacitor and enabling high-density memory architectures.

The work focuses on Write–Hold–Read (WHR) dynamics, with particular emphasis on retention behavior during hold states, which is the defining characteristic of DRAM operation.

Key Concepts

Floating-body charge storage in a double-gate MOSFET

Capacitor-less (1T) DRAM architecture

Transient TCAD simulation of memory states

Non-local band-to-band tunneling and impact ionization for charge generation

Retention analysis under HOLD-1 and HOLD-0 conditions

Device Structure

Double-gate MOSFET geometry

Silicon body with heavily doped source/drain regions

SiO₂ gate dielectrics on top and bottom

Quantum tunneling regions defined near source and drain

Floating body region enabling charge retention

The structure is discretized using a non-uniform mesh optimized near tunneling and junction regions to ensure numerical accuracy.

Simulation Flow

The memory operation is modeled using a sequence of transient simulations:

Initialization

Device brought to equilibrium

Write-1

Bias conditions induce charge storage in the floating body

Hold-1

All body contacts removed; stored charge retention is observed

Read-1

Small sensing bias applied to detect stored state

Write-0

Stored charge is removed

Hold-0

Leakage-dominated state verification

Read-0

Confirmation of low-current state

Each operation is simulated using time-domain analysis to capture dynamic charge behavior.

Physical Models

The following models are employed (enabled selectively depending on simulation phase):

SRH recombination

Bandgap narrowing

Concentration-dependent mobility

Non-local band-to-band tunneling

Impact ionization (Selberherr model)

Fermi–Dirac statistics

Model complexity is reduced during debugging of retention behavior and progressively re-enabled for realism.
